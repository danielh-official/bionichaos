            <h2>Web-App Overview</h2>
            <p>This interactive simulation demonstrates the biomechanical concept of "Smartphone Neck" or "Text Neck."
                It visualizes how the effective load on your cervical spine (neck) dramatically increases as you tilt
                your head forward, a common posture when using smartphones or other handheld devices.</p>
            <p>The simulation uses data consistent with the widely cited study by K. K. Hansraj (2014), illustrating
                that a 60-degree forward tilt can put as much as 27 kilograms (about 60 pounds) of force on your neck,
                equivalent to carrying a 7-year-old child on your head!</p>
            <p>Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for promoting healthier digital habits and preventing
                musculoskeletal issues related to prolonged poor posture.</p>

        <section id="how-to-use">
            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adjust Head Angle:</strong> Use the "Head Angle" slider to manually change the tilt of the
                    head. You can drag the slider with your mouse or finger, or use the left/right arrow keys when the
                    slider is focused.</li>
                <li><strong>Observe Load:</strong> As you change the angle, observe the "Effective Load on Neck"
                    displayed below the slider. The weight icon on the person's head will also visually represent the
                    load.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Stress Indicators:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The neck area changes color from green (low stress) to red (high stress)</li>
                        <li>The weight icon grows larger and turns red as the load increases</li>
                        <li>Red force arrows show the direction and magnitude of the load</li>
                        <li>Stress radiations appear at the neck base showing concentration points</li>
                        <li>The spine line thickness and color indicate stress levels</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reset Button:</strong> Click or tap the "Reset (0°)" button to bring the head back to a
                    neutral, upright position.</li>
                <li><strong>Play Demo:</strong> Click or tap the "Play Demo" button to initiate an automatic sequence
                    that cycles through various angles, showcasing the increasing load. This is useful for quickly
                    grasping the concept.</li>
                <li><strong>Sonification Toggle:</strong> Use the switch to turn sound effects on or off. When on, the
                    pitch of a tone will change, becoming higher as the effective load increases, providing an auditory
                    representation of the strain.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress Legend:</strong> Check the top-right corner of the simulation for a visual stress
                    level indicator and color coding explanation.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on
                    desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>This simulation provides a foundational understanding. Potential enhancements could include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More Detailed Anatomy:</strong> Adding more anatomical detail to the spine and muscles to
                    better illustrate where the stress occurs.</li>
                <li><strong>User Input for Head Weight:</strong> Allowing users to input their estimated head weight for
                    a more personalized simulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Posture Feedback:</strong> Integrating with device sensors (if possible in a web context,
                    e.g., webcam posture analysis) to provide real-time feedback on user's posture.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise Suggestions:</strong> Including a section with recommended neck stretches and
                    strengthening exercises to counteract the effects of "Smartphone Neck."</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility Improvements:</strong> Enhancing keyboard navigation and screen reader support
                    for a wider audience.</li>

                    deeper scientific understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Data View:</strong> Allowing users to log their usage patterns (if integrated
                    with a tracking app) and see historical data on cumulative neck strain.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="exercises">
            <h2>Exercises to Counteract "Smartphone Neck"</h2>
            <p>Perform these simple exercises regularly to help alleviate neck strain and improve posture.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chin Tucks:</strong> Sit or stand tall. Gently tuck your chin towards your neck, as if
                    making a double chin. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li><strong>Neck Tilts (Side to Side):</strong> Slowly tilt your head, bringing your ear towards your
                    right shoulder. Hold for 15-20 seconds. Repeat on the left side.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoulder Blade Squeezes:</strong> Squeeze your shoulder blades together. Hold for 5 seconds
                    and repeat 15 times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If you experience pain, stop immediately and consult a healthcare
                professional.</p>
